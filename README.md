## In this demo I'm explaining how to use git by performing the following steps:

- Create a repository
- Change the README.md file
- Create a branch to add a pair plot
- Merge it into main
- Create a second branch to replace the pair plot with a KDE plot
- Checkout to main and commit a title change to fabricate a conflict when
  merging the second branch into main
- Merge the second branch into main solving the conflict and adding the
  two plots to the final work

A presentation with some useful links to learn git and gitkraken is found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10-Lto8_o4Dgo3G_ZhSEA5gQdHNctE5aWslpOzJ6s0K8/edit#slide=id.gd69d42d794_0_229).
